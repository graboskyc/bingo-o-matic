# Bingo-o-matic Implementation Plan

## 1. Project Architecture

Create a Blazor WebAssembly (.NET 9) application with:
- No server-side components (100% client-side)
- PWA capabilities for offline support
- IndexedDB storage for persistence
- Minimal dependencies

## 2. Core Components

### 2.1 Landing Page
- Hero section with tagline
- Feature highlights
- Launch button (primary CTA)
- Footer with MIT license and GitHub links
- Lightweight CSS animations

### 2.2 Application Shell
- Navigation between modes
- Current state indicators
- App container with responsive layout

### 2.3 Standard Bingo Mode
- 5Ã—5 grid with B-I-N-G-O headers
- Free center square
- Random number pool (1-75)
- Next number animation display
- Called number tracking
- Reset and shuffle controls

### 2.4 Custom Bingo Mode
- Text input for custom word lists
- List validation
- Multiple reveal styles:
  - Roulette wheel animation
  - Card flip animation
  - List ticker animation
- Called item highlighting
- Style switching controls

## 3. Data Management

### 3.1 State Management
- Game state tracking (current numbers/words, called items)
- UI state management (current mode, animations)
- Local persistence of state

### 3.2 Storage Implementation
- IndexedDB for saving custom lists
- Current board state persistence
- Clear data functionality

## 4. Offline Capabilities

### 4.1 PWA Configuration
- Service worker setup
- App manifest
- Asset caching strategy
- Offline fallbacks
- Update notifications

### 4.2 Performance Optimizations
- WASM size optimization (IL trimming, AOT)
- Brotli compression
- Lazy loading where appropriate
- CSS performance considerations

## 5. Accessibility & Cross-Platform

### 5.1 Accessibility Implementation
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Screen reader support
- Keyboard navigation
- Focus management
- High contrast considerations

### 5.2 Cross-Browser Testing
- Target browsers: Edge 110+, Safari 15+, Chrome 108+
- Responsive design for mobile, tablet, desktop
- Touch interface optimization

## 6. Development Phases

Follow these milestones from the PRD:
1. Design phase (wireframes, CSS prototypes)
2. Core engine implementation
3. Custom mode implementation
4. PWA/offline capabilities
5. Landing page development
6. QA and accessibility testing
7. Launch preparations

## 7. Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for core game logic
- Component tests for UI elements
- Accessibility audits
- Performance benchmarks
- Offline functionality testing
- Cross-browser compatibility tests

## 8. Deployment

- Static hosting (GitHub Pages, Azure Static Web Apps, etc.)
- CI/CD pipeline for automated builds and testing
- Cache invalidation strategy for updates
